- 👋 Hi, I’m @thunkadelic, a bookseller and code dilettante.
- 👀 I’m interested in GRUB2 and BLS, and book and bookmark cataloging systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with GRUB2 and BLS, and GraphicsMagick.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting GRUB2 and BLS to work better with icons for different Linux distributions and other OS.
